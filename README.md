# Me-Core
# Hey there 👋 I'm Khushi!

I’m a BCA student who’s super into tech, design, and building cool stuff that actually *means* something.  
Currently juggling college, coding, and creative projects (and doing a pretty good job at it 😌).

🌱 What I’m learning right now:
- Python, R, and SQL (data things got me curious 📊)
- HTML & CSS (yes, I’m that girl who likes designing websites late at night)
- A bit of GitHub + real-life project workflow

🎨 Things I enjoy doing:
- Designing creative stuff on Canva
- Making websites for things I care about
- Reading dark romance books (don’t judge 🤭)
- Working on passion projects that mix logic + love (like a donation website or a personal jar project 💌)

💻 Skills I'm building:
- Python basics + data handling
- Web design (HTML/CSS/Canva)
- SQL & R (still a baby but learning fast)
- Canva, VS Code, GitHub, and good ol’ Google

🧠 Projects in progress:
- A website for an NGO that donates clothes & food 🧣🍱  
- Learning to analyze datasets without losing my mind 🤯
